# Lattice QCD SVD 
Lattice QCD is a well-established non-perturbative approach to solving the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theory of quarks and gluons. 

This notebook computes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Lattice QCD Data for the case of Zero Momentum Transfer. 

Note: Ratio Error Values from QCD Zero momentum simulation, and Momentum Permutations stipulated theoretically.
